Therefore I was denied because I'm American. They also do not accept duplicate licenses. I had many other forms of identification to prove it was really me ex pay stubs in my wallet insurance card credit cards debit card and college Id with photo and was still denied.

Went there for breakfast where we had to pay $5.00 to park. In the past, this was deducted from the breakfast bill. The ""New Owners"" now say that the charge will be deducted if you return for dinner or to use them to access the beach Mon. to Fri.  So to park and walk into Caddys to eat a moderately priced breakfast you have to pay $5.00 just to park.
